# bash uses a combination of the 'if' builtin and the 'test' utility for conditionals
# the '[' symbol is used as a synonym for 'test' on most systems

# the '[' utility has various operators for comparing its arguments
[ -x /bin/foo ] && foo # if /bin/foo exists and is executable, run it
[ ! -z $STR ] || echo '$STR is zero (undefined)!'

# full conditionals take the form if ; the of n ; elif then ; fi
MYVAR="My variable"
if [ "$MYVAR" = "My variable" ]; then
	# do something
elif [ "$MYVAR" = "Something else" ]; then
	# do something else
else
	# do something otherwise
fi

# bash conditionals have lots of nuances, including the non-POSIX '[['
# keyword, which behaves slightly differently from POSIX 'test' or '['.
# it's a good idea to read the manpages to get a better grasp of their interactions.
