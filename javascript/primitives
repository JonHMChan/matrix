// numbers are all of the same type (64-bit IEEE 754 double)
// for the most part this should be okay

// an explicit type for something that is not a number
NaN; // occurs when you do something weird like add undefined to a number

// strings can be enclosed with double or single quotes
"a string"; // double quotes
'another string'; // single quotes

// booleans
  //booleans can be either number based like 1 = 1 or finding the length of something and comparing.
1 == 1;
//result returns true
true;
100 == 1200;
//the result returns false
false;
//comparing lengths boolean
"HS Hackers".length == "Are awesome!!!!".length;
//this would return false, since "HS Hackers" w/ the space is (10), while "Are awesome!!!!" returns (15).

// undefined type, means a variable is declared but not assigned
var x; // = undefined

// null, means no value is present, subtlely different from undefined
null; // = null
null === undefined; // = false

// more on false-like, empty-like values later
