#Booleans in python can be assigned to variables as follows
honesty = True
fake = False

#Boolean operators are as follows
7 == 7                         #This is True because 7 equals itself
2 != 2                         #This is False because 2 does equal itself
2 <> 4                         #This is True because 2 does not equal itself. NOTE: no longer supported in Python 3.x
3 > 1                          #True because 3 is greater than 1
6 < 1                          #False because 6 isn't less than 1
2 >= 2                         #True because 2 is greater than or EQUAL to itself
2 <= 2                         #True becuase 2 is less than or EQUAL to itself

#Also if you add the word 'not' infront of a statement it negates it so
not (2 == 2)                   #False because 2 equals 2 is true and negate that making false
not (2 > 3)                    #True because 2 is greater than 3 is false and negate that making it true

#There are also AND and OR conditons. 
(2 == 2 and 2 < 4)              #2 True statements evaluate to True
(2 != 3 and 2 < 1)              #One True AND one False statement evaluate to False when using the and statement
(5 > 9  and 4 < 3)              #2 False statements evaluate to False

(6 == 6 or 6 < 11)              #2 True statements evaluate to True
(8 < 10 or 2 < 13)              #one True OR one false statement evaluate to True when using the or statement
(1 > 7  or 5 <= 4)              #2 False statements evaluate to False
