#the def keyword is used to make a function in python.
#code that is part of the function needs to be indented four spaces

def first_hello():
    name = str(input("What is your name? "))
    print("Hello {}".format(name))
    
#functions can take arguments as well.
def second_hello(name):
    print("Hello {}".format(name))
    
#to call a function simply simply type the name of the function
#followed by its parameter(s) (if it takes any).

first_hello()  
second_hello("Samuel")  # since we have to pass a string for the name argument
