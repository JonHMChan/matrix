#Python is an object-oriented and high-level programming language.
#Currently there are two prominent Python versions: Python 2.7 and Python 3.
#Although some differences do exist between the two, there is still a strong resemblance.
#Python was made for simplicity and clarity, yet is still capable of creating powerful applications.
#Some major uses for Python among others, would be web applications through the Django framework,
#and for microcomputers such as Raspberry Pi.
