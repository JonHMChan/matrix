#loops are used to repeat parts of your code.
#There are two main ways to loop in Python,
#Using a FOR loop and a WHILE loop

#a for loop is written like this, the spaces are mandatory
for i in range(1,10):
    print(i)        

#make sure to add a comma in between your numbers and a colon at the end of the initial line.
#the range function is exclusive therefore the output would be numbers 1 through 9 not including 10.

#a while loop is written as follows
x = 10
y = 0
while x > y:  # once again, indentation is required
    print("while loop example")
    y += 1  #this iterates variable y every time the loop is runned (same as writing y = y + 1)
  
#the result would be outputting "while loop example" ten times,
#until x is no longer greater than y

#be sure to familiarize yourself with the BREAK and CONTINUE statements as well, 
#as they are vital for mastering python's loop control flow.
