#Everything in python is considered an object.
#To create your own objects you first need to create a class
#which can be done as follows. Remember to indent!

class Fruit:  # class names should always be capitalized
    bio = "fruit"  # this is a class attribute
        
    def ready(self, color):  # All methods in a class need the self argument
        self.color = color
        if self.color == "green":
            return "The fruit is ripe."
        else:
            return "The fruit isn't ready yet"
            
class Watermelon(Fruit):  # The new class inherits everything from the Fruit class
    bio = "watermelon"    #  overwrite the bio attribute for the watermelon class
    
#To make objects simply assign the class to a variable.

fruit = Fruit()
watermelon = Watermelon()

#Access object attributes as follows

print(fruit.bio)  # prints out "fruit"
print(watermelon.bio)  # prints out "watermelon"

#To call object methods do

print(watermelon.ready("green"))  # should print out "The fruit is ripe". 
                                  # remember Watermelon inherited the ready method from Fruit.
