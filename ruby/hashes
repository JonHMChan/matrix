#In order to create a hash in Ruby do as follows

exHash = {
  :first => 1,             #in older ruby versions the norm was to use an equals sign followed by a greater than sign. BE SURE TO ADD COMMAS between Key-value pairs
  second: 3                #the current norm is separate the key from the value using a colon similar to a dictionary in Python
}

#Additionally you can create a hash by doing
sampleHash = Hash.new
sampleHash["one"] = 1      #Adds Key one paired with value 1 to the hash sampleHash
